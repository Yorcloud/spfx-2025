## Top-Level Fields

- **name**: `"spfx-2025"`  
  The name of the project. This is used to identify the package in npm and other tooling.

- **version**: `"0.0.1"`  
  The current version of the project, following semantic versioning. This is useful for tracking releases and dependencies.

- **private**: `true`  
  Marks the package as private, preventing it from being accidentally published to the public npm registry.

- **engines**:  
  Specifies the versions of Node.js that are compatible with this project. Here, it requires Node.js version 22.14.0 or higher, but less than 23.0.0.

- **main**: `"lib/index.js"`  
  The entry point for the package if it were to be used as a library. For SPFx projects, this is typically not used, but is included for completeness.

- **scripts**:  
  Defines command-line scripts for common tasks:
  - **build**: Runs `gulp bundle` to build the project.
  - **clean**: Runs `gulp clean` to remove build artifacts.
  - **test**: Runs `gulp test` to execute tests.

## Dependencies

- **tslib**:  
  The TypeScript runtime library, providing helper functions for TypeScript features such as extending classes and spreading objects. It helps reduce the output size of compiled TypeScript code by referencing these helpers instead of inlining them.

- **react**:  
  The core React library, used for building user interfaces with a component-based architecture. In SPFx, React is commonly used to create web part UIs.

- **react-dom**:  
  Provides DOM-specific methods for React, such as rendering components into the DOM. It is required for mounting React components in web parts.

- **@fluentui/react**:  
  Fluent UI React is a collection of robust React components that implement Microsoft's Fluent Design System. It is used to build consistent, accessible, and visually appealing user interfaces in SPFx solutions.

- **@microsoft/sp-core-library**:  
  Contains core SharePoint Framework (SPFx) APIs and utilities, such as environment detection, logging, and versioning. It is essential for any SPFx project.

- **@microsoft/sp-component-base**:  
  Provides base classes and interfaces for SPFx components, such as web parts and extensions. It enables consistent component development within the SPFx ecosystem.

- **@microsoft/sp-property-pane**:  
  Supplies APIs for building and managing the property pane, which allows users to configure web part properties in SharePoint.

- **@microsoft/sp-webpart-base**:  
  Contains the base class for SPFx client-side web parts, as well as supporting types and utilities. All web parts in SPFx extend from this package.

- **@microsoft/sp-lodash-subset**:  
  A subset of the popular Lodash utility library, optimized and curated for SPFx. It provides commonly used utility functions with a smaller footprint.

- **@microsoft/sp-office-ui-fabric-core**:  
  Provides core styles and fonts from Office UI Fabric (now part of Fluent UI), ensuring that SPFx components visually align with the rest of SharePoint and Office 365.

  A Microsoft-maintained wrapper for a specific TypeScript compiler version, ensuring consistent builds across environments. It is used in SPFx projects to align with the toolchain.

- **@rushstack/eslint-config**:  
  Provides a set of ESLint rules and configurations recommended by the Rush Stack team, helping maintain code quality and consistency.

- **@microsoft/eslint-plugin-spfx**:  
  An ESLint plugin with rules specific to SPFx projects, helping enforce best practices and catch common mistakes in SPFx code.

- **@microsoft/eslint-config-spfx**:  
  The recommended ESLint configuration for SPFx projects, bundling together rules and plugins for SharePoint development.

- **@microsoft/sp-build-web**:  
  The main build tool for SPFx web parts, providing Gulp tasks and build pipelines tailored for SharePoint development.

- **@types/webpack-env**:  
  TypeScript type definitions for Webpack's special variables and APIs, enabling type-safe access to Webpack features in the codebase.

- **ajv**:  
  Another JSON Schema Validator, a fast and flexible JSON schema validator used for validating configuration files and data structures.

- **eslint**:  
  A popular JavaScript and TypeScript linter, used to analyze code for potential errors and enforce coding standards.

- **gulp**:  
  A streaming build system for automating tasks such as building, testing, and deploying code. SPFx uses Gulp as its primary task runner.

- **typescript**:  
  The TypeScript compiler, used to transpile TypeScript code into JavaScript. The version specified ensures compatibility with the rest of the SPFx toolchain.

- **@types/react**:  
  TypeScript type definitions for React, enabling type checking and IntelliSense for React components and APIs.

- **@types/react-dom**:  
  TypeScript type definitions for ReactDOM, providing type safety for DOM-related React APIs.

- **eslint-plugin-react-hooks**:  
  An ESLint plugin that enforces the rules of React Hooks, helping prevent common mistakes when using hooks in React components.

- **@microsoft/sp-module-interfaces**:  
  Contains TypeScript interfaces for SPFx modules, ensuring type safety and consistency when developing SPFx components.
